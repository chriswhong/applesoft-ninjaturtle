# applesoft-ninjaturtle
Applesoft Low Resolution Graphics from 1991

I kept a printout of this program from when I was in the 5th grade at Kemp Mill Elementary School in Silver Spring, MD.  

I thought it would be fun to OCR it and put it on github.

##How to Use

Run the program in ninjaturtle.txt in Applesoft.  If you don't have an Apple II handy, use this [web-based emulator](http://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/index.htm).
