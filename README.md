Applesoft Low Resolution Graphics from 1991

In the 5th grade, we had a class on making low resolution graphics on an Apple IIe.  I kept a paper printout of this program, along with a color print of the output, and it's been sitting in my file cabinet for 25 years.  

I thought it would be fun to OCR it and put it on github.

## How to Use

Run the program in ninjaturtle.txt in Applesoft.  If you don't have an Apple II handy, use this [web-based emulator](http://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/).

## Printout from 1991
This was printed on an ImageWriter II dot matrix printer with a color ribbon.  Please note the doodle of Shredder towards the bottom of the page.
